Before running this program, you must create a database called "PLCT1", and run the script found here:

PLCT1.DataAccess/Scripts/MessageTable.sql


The AP.NET host address must also be copied into the urlBase value in this script:

PLCT1.WebAPI/Scripts/custom_MessageKoBinding.js

The port number portion of the URL will probably need ot be updated.
